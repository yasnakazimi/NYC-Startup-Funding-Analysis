##  Two Versions of the Project  

###  Python Version  
This version uses **Python** to perform data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.  
It leverages libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **Scikit-learn** to explore startup funding patterns in New York City.  

Key highlights include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using Pandas  
- Visualization of top-funded industries and funding trends  
- Machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) with an AUC score of **~0.76**  
- Analysis of COVID-19’s impact on investor activity between 2015–2023

###  R Version  
This version applies **R** for statistical exploration and visualization using **tidyverse**, **ggplot2**, **dplyr**, and **janitor**.  
It focuses on analyzing startup funding distribution, industry performance, and the relationship between funding and success outcomes through logistic regression.  

Key highlights include:
- Data cleaning and preparation with tidyverse  
- Visualization of funding by industry and startup status  
- Logistic regression to predict acquisition likelihood
